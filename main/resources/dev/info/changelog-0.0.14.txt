Changes:
- Changed Message Block!
  Linebreaks are now done with a single '\'.

Changes (internal):

Fixes:
- Fixed the bug that prevented pistons from working.
    Bug reason:
    TaleCraft registered tileentities in the
    'pre_init' method instead of the 'init' method.
- Fixed the InfoBar not displaying metadata.
- Fixed the bug that linebreaks don't work in the Message-Block.
- Fixed the bug that made scripts not work.
  Caused by: Gradle not copying a bunch of files. (WHY?!)

Example Script
--------------
    // Print the position of the block executing this script to the console...
    out.println(position);

    // Build a 32 blocks high pillar, starting 3 blocks above the executor
    for (var y = position.y() + 3, count = 0; count < 32; y++, count++) {
        
        // "minecraft:stained_glass" is the type identifier.
        // 'count % 16' is the metadata value of the block.
        id = "minecraft:stained_glass/"+(count % 16);
        
        // get the 'blockstate'
        block = system.getBlock(id);
        
        // Places a block of the given blockstate at the given position.
        world.setBlock(position.x(), y, position.z(), block);
    }

    // end of script
