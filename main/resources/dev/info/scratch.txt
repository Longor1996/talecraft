command -> /tc_region < ? >
    /tc_region
      Operates on regions selected by the wand and the ones stored in the server clipboard.
    
    Notes:
      * The 'clipboard' is on the server-side.
        - The clipboard contents are DELETED on server termination.
        - The clipboard is globally accessible by EVERYBODY ANY TIME.
        - The clipboard uses the 'prop'-format to store things.
          This means that entities can be stored in the clipboard.
      * A single-entry 'clipboard' is on the client-side.
      * The clipboard of a given player can only be set/modified/cleared by that player.
      * All players can access any other players clipboard, but cannot modify it.
      * The name of a players private clipboard is always defined as 'player.<UUID>'.
      * SELF
        - SELF means either means 'this players selection' or 'this players clipboard'.
        - SELF is only available if the sender of the command is a player.
        - SELF references a players private clipboard named 'player.<UUID>'.
      * PasteItem
        - If a PasteItem instance is named the clipboard-entry with
          that name will be used instead of the players private clipboard.
    
    /tc_region cut <name|SELF> <<x0> <y0> <z0> <x1> <y1> <z1>|SELF>
       Cuts out a piece of the world and creates a new schematic in the clipboard from that.
    
    /tc_region copy <name|SELF> <<x0> <y0> <z0> <x1> <y1> <z1>|SELF>
       Copies a piece of the world and creates a new schematic in the clipboard from that.
       NOTE: This subcommand is half-way implemented already.
    
    /tc_region paste <name|SELF> <x> <y> <z>
       Copies a specific schematic from the clipboard into the world at a specific position.

item -> VoxelBrush: (partially implemented)
  - FUNCTIONS
    * smooth-average -> Smooths the voxels together over a given area based on a average.
    * smooth-cubic -> Smooths the voxels together over a given area with a cube-kernel.
^^




item -> TerrainBrush:
  This tool acts upon the worlds heightmap.
  - SHAPES
    * Box
    * Circle (default)
  - FUNCTIONS
    * brush
      The brush can be any size between 4 and 32.
      The brush works solely on the heightmap (which is 2D!).
      The brush should have a direct visualization of what changes.
      The brush formula is as following:
        height.new = height.old + brush.power * brush.value[|height.xz -> brush.center.xz|]
      
      * add : Adds height to the terrain.
      * subtract : Subtracts height from the terrain.
      * flatten : Flattens the terrain to the height at the center of the brush.
      * smooth : Smooths out the terrain.
      * BRUSHES
        * Flat
        * Linear
        * Smooth (default)
        * Sinus
        * Spike
        * Gaussian
        * Noise
    * grassify -> Replace every solid block that is euqal to ARG2 or is natural and has air above it with grass.

# Not really useful with the features listed below. :/
gui -> MapInterface:
  - A gui that is opened by pressing 'M' on the keyboard without any special keys.
  - The gui contains tabs that contains GUI's for different tools and utilities.
  - TABS:

      # Apart from being able to see the gamerules, this isn't really necessary.
    - Resources: View and browse ALL resources currently loaded in the game. (textures[block, item, entity, *], sounds, music)
      # This is not possible.
^^



system -> CLIPBOARD (!!!)
  The 'clipboard' is a system that allows players to store something called 'props'.
  
  CLIPBOARD
    - The clipboard is mostly on the server-side of things.
    - The clipboard solely stores 'props' and nothing else.
    - There is a so-called 'private clipboard' that is per-player, and exists on the client AND the server. (synchronized!)
    - Players can look into (and copy!) the private clipboard of other players, but not modify them.
  
  PROP
    - A 'prop' is a collection of objects in a 3D-space.
    - A prop can store these things: Blocks, Entitties, Metadata.
    - Props can be saved from the clipboard to a harddrive.
    - Props can be loaded from a hardrive into the clipboard.
