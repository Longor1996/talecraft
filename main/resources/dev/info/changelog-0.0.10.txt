Changes (internal):
- Refactored settings system on the client side.
  - Settings get saved when changed.
  - Settings get send to server when relevent settings changed.
  - Sending settings to server now happens in a seperate StringNBTCommand.
  - Code looks much nicer.



Fixes:
- Fixed a bug that some block types could not be found with the new type syntax.
  The bug was caused by a mismatch in the unlacalized name with the given type.

- Fixed the crashbug that was caused when loading BlockTriggerInvoke's.
  Bug was caused by autocomplete importing the wrong class.

Warnings:
- Do NOT sprint-teleport too fast with the Teleporter,
  as this WILL cause the internal server to hang up.
