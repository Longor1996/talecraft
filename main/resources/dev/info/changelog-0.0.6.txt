- Added new action to voxelbrush: eraser
- Added new action to voxelbrush: maskreplace

- Added new block: ScriptBlock.

- Added scripting. (!!!)
  Scripting is based on JavaScript (using the Rhino library).
  Right now you can only use the script-block to run scripts (there will be more ways to run a script later).
  
  When scripting, you will always have access to these two objects:
  * system: Contains functions to create (and get) all objects from Minecraft you could possibly needs.
  * out: The console output. Use 'println()'!
  
  When a script is ran from a block, the following is avialable:
  * world: The world the block is contained within.
  * position: The position of the block.
  
  To find out more about a given object (fields/methods), do one of the following:
    out.println(OBJECT.getOwnPropertyNames());
    out.println(OBJECT);
  This SHOULD work with pretty much every object you can get your hands on while scripting.

- Added script wrappers for:
  * World
    * Scoreboard (Scoreboard, Objective, Score)
    * WorldBorder
    * Gamerules
  * Block (Block, IBlockState)
  * Item (Item, ItemStack)
  * Potion (Potion, PotionEffect)
  * Entity (Entity, EntityLiving)
  * NBT

- Added tooltips in all the existing GUI's.

- Fixed the incorrect display of some items names in the InfoBar.
- Fixed that placing a trigger-block in the same spot as another trigger-block causes serious data corruption.
- Fixed the bug that clockblocks instantly start their countdown as they are placed down.

- Made redstone-triggers triggerable by other trigger blocks, instead of just redstone signals.

- Added new block: Redstone Activator
  This block is like a minecraft:lever (it can be on/off and emits a redstone signal),
  with the difference that it is enabled/disabled by triggering it.

- Did some SERIOUS refactoring. There are now 36 folders of code. Also fixed a couple of small bugs while doing so.

- Added new visulaization mode: Nightvision
