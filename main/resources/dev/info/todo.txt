### MISCELLANIUS

- Find a way to force the 'yes'-option in the "Accept Resourcepack Prompt" GUI.
  Note: Workaround does not work. There are no hooks in the relevant code.
        Ergo: Not possible.



### BLOCKS / ITEMS

- Fix the bug that the URL is not shown in the 'Confirm Open Link' dialog
  when opened by the URL-Block.
  Possible Fix: Write my own 'Open Link' GUI.

- Show the wand selection of other players if possible.
  THIS IS POSSIBLY A BAD IDEA. DONT DO IT.

- Make the 'actions' of action blocks visible in the invoke tracker bar.
  Note:
    This requires the 'trigger' function in Invoke.java to
    send a packet for every single triggered block. Bad idea!

- Implement the ClipBlock as specified in scratch.txt
  CURRENTLY NOT POSSIBLE BECAUSE OF RENDERING PROBLEMS.
  
- Implement the TerrainBrush-item.
  CURRENTLY NOT POSSIBLE BECAUSE OF MISSING KNOWLEDGE.

- Implement grass blocks.
  WAIT: For textures from 'Daggard'. (only a few are missing)
- Implement class to support directional models.
  WAIT: 1.9 will bring support for 'if X then Y' into the model format.
- Take a look at Potofantom's block models. (Look into collecting folder './desktop/scrwat/')
  WAIT: Models like this will get simpler with the 1.9 'if X then Y' modelsystem feature.

- ~~~Find a way to implement the custom mob spawner with all its functions.~~~
  Problem: The correct serialization/deserialization of the spawned entitites list.

- The following blocks are currently missing:
    - static
    darkness
    clip
    - dynamic
    store
    music
    sky
    url
    mobSpawner
    potionEffectZone
    - triggers
    key trigger



### SCRIPTING
- !!! Put a class-shutter into Rhino for security reasons.

- Create a ingame editor for FileScriptInvoke. (need: QADTextArea)
- Create a ingame editor for EmbeddedScriptInvoke. (need: QADTextArea)

- Create all the wrappers necessary for scripting in minecraft. (This will take a LOT of time!)
  - Wrappers are necessary because of the class obfuscation and because of security concerns.
  - Completion: ~30%. Basics are covered.

- Add ALL the missing parameters to the invoke calls.
  Note: Only create the parameter map if the invoke is of type IScriptInvoke.
        If its not let the parameter map be null, the Invoke system doesn't care.



### INTERNALS
- !!! MAKE GOD DAMN SURE THAT NO CLIENT CODE IS ON THE SERVER SIDE!

- Refactor the GuiEntityEditor class. Make it less cluttered.
  - Refactor all 'panels' into their own classes.
  - Create methods to create the editor fields simpler.

- Try to find a way to reduce the massive amount of lag when displaying the item-list.
  Note: This is caused by the Font-Renderer being the most horrible font-renderer in existance.
        Ergo: Can't fix this problem. :(
        Note: Could fix if I build my own fontrenderer.
              Would take too much time though...

- Change the names of ALL server commands to fit better.
  e.g:
  server.<?>

- Create a debug window (/swing) that can be opened alongside Minecraft on the SERVER side.
  The window should do the following:
  - Show a prompt to submit commands to the server and get the results.
  - Show a realtime data view of single blocks.
  - Show a realtime data view of a group of blocks.
  - Show all the invokes as they happen.
  - Show all the events as they happen.
  - Show all the loaded scripts.
