Changes:
- Added new block: Collision Trigger Block
  When a entity starts colliding with this block, a invoke will get executed.
  When the entity stops colliding with this block, another invoke gets executed.
  
  The GUI is pretty empty, and only contains the 'start' and 'stop' invokes.
  
  Script Parameters:
  - 'entity': The entity that is starting/stopping to collide.

- Added new decoration blocks:
  deco_wood_a (x16)

- Added new subcommand to: /tc_vz
  /tc_vz sh chunk
  Sorrounds the chunk you are in with a box.

- Added new set of gamerules:
  * disable.damage.*: If active, all damage is disabled globally.
  * disable.damage.fall: If active, fall damage is disabled globally.
  * disable.damage.lava: If active, lava damage is disabled globally.
  * disable.damage.fire: If active, fire damage is disabled globally.
  * disable.damage.magic: If active, fall damage is disabled globally.
  * disable.damage.drown: If active, drowning damage is disabled globally.
  * disable.damage.suffocate: If active, suffocation damage is disabled globally.
  
  'globally' menas for ALL entities across the ENTIRE map/world.

- Added new decoration blocks:
  deco_stone_d (x16)
  deco_stone_e (x16)


- Changed Image Hologram Block:
  If the 'width' is negative, the image will be repeated along the X-Axis.
  If the 'height' is negative, the image will be repeated along the Y-Axis.

- Added new decoration blocks:
  deco_stone_f (x16)
  deco_glass_a (x16)

- Added new subcommand to: /tc_wand
  /tc_wand region repeat <count> [direction]
  
  Repeats the currently selected region in the given direction 'count' times.
  If 'direction' is not given, the direction the player is looking in is used.
  Minimum 'count' is 1, maximum is 128.

- Added new block: Light Block
  This block can emit a customizable amount of light,
  and it can be turned on/off per trigger!

- Added new item: Meta Swapper
  Changes the state of blocks (if possible).

- Added new block: Hidden Block
  This block is always invisible+invincible and can not be collided with,
  but is 'solid' so blocks like ladders/torches can be placed on it.

- Added new decoration blocks:
  deco_cage_a (x12)

- Added new system: Entity Editor
  Left-Click ANY entity with the Wand-item to edit that entities data.
  Alternatively, use the '/tc_editentity' command.
  
  Raw NBT will also be shown if the small checkbox in the upper right of
  the GUI is toggled on. The 'Copy to Clipboard as JSON'-button is there too.
  
  If the entity has an inventory of any kind, you can edit the items in that
  inventory by clicking on the buttons that show up as 'slots'.
  Some entities allow adding new items to the inventory.
  
  Notes:
  - The GUI *should* be pretty self explaining.
  - The GUI is generated procdurally from the data of the given entity.
  - The GUI can cause serios lag because there is so much text.

- Added new command: /tc_editentity
  /tc_editentity <selector>
  
  Opens the entity editor for the given entity.
  
  Possible selectors:
  - self
  - @a @e @r @p
  
  Warning: If neither "self" or a entity-selector is given,
           the command will assume that the selector is a UUID.
           A UUID is a long piece of text that globally identifies a entity.

- Added new system: Itemstack Editor
  This editor allows one to change the attributes of a itemstack.
  Currently only used in Entity-Editor. Later usage in Store-Block.

- Added new subcommand to: /tc_wand
  /tc_wand region butcher
  Kills all living things (and items) in the selected region.

- Added new item: Spawn Point
  Spawns a tc_point entity at the current position and rotation.
  
  Note: The point entity may later be used to implement cutscenes.
        If you feel funny, you can do so right now with scripts.

- Changed Teleporter-Item and Point-Entity:
  Mounting a point entity with the teleporter works correctly now.

- Changed GUI: Emitter Block Gui
  You can now directly select the particle type in the '?' dialog.

- Replaced the old talecraft logo with the one provided by Morning_Woody (heh).
  INFO @ WIKI: Replace the TaleCraft logo with the new one!

- Added new command: /tc_attack
  /tc_attack <entity-selector> <damage-type> <damage-amount>
  
  Attacks the selected entities with the given damate type and amount.
  
  Entity-Selector:
    @e @a @p @r
  
  Damage types:
    magic anvil cactus drown fall fallingblock generic fire
    wall lava lightingbolt onfire out_of_world starve wither
  
  Damage amount:
    0 .. 1000

- Added new block: Message Block
  This block sends a message to a seleted set of players when triggered.
  
  Options:
    - message: The message to send. Linebreaks are done with '\n'.
    - selector: The selector that selects the players to send the message to.
    - tellraw: If the message should be threated as /tellraw-style JSON.

- Added new block: Inverter Block
  Inverts any incoming trigger signal and executes a invoke with that.

- Added new block: Memory Block
  This block executes a invoke when triggered,
  and it does so only ONCE, then never again unless reset.

- Changed InfoBar:
  [MIN] | [MAX] -> [SIZE] = [VOLUME]
  
  Note: MIN and MAX might sometimes go out of sync with the server.

- Added new block: Trigger Filter
  Filters selected trigger signals.

Changes (internal):
- Added 'parameters' to invokes.
  Scripts now get, depending on the context, additional parameters.
  These 'dynamic' parameters only exist for the duration of the invoke.
- ImageHologramBlock no longer uses the BoxRenderer for the 'hologram'.
- Refactored the '/tc_wand'-command a lot. Lot's of methods now.
- (!) Changed the StringNBTCommand packet to use compressed reading/writing.
  This should improve network performance.
- The text on QADButton's can now be aligned left/right.
- Pressing 'F1' in a QAD-based GUI will now show the 'hitboxes' of components.
  (Useful for creating layout's)
- Added a brand new toJson(NBT)-method. Is used in the entity editor.
- Completely redid the Block-Trigger part of the invoke system.
  Now works correctly with ON/OFF/INVERT/IGNORE.

Fixes:
- Fixed the bug that one HAS to click in the air to copy a region of blocks with the COPY/CUT items.
- Fixed 'copy' and 'spawn' messages for pasting blocks and entities into the world.
- Fixed the bug that the InfoBar is not displayed while the chat is open.
- Fixed the bug that living entities try to jump on top of utility blocks.
