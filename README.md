# TaleCraft
This is the official repository for the Minecraft-mod **TaleCraft**.

> TaleCraft gives you the tools and abilities to create more in-depth adventure maps, improve your control over the environment, and help tell an epic tale. Whether you're an adventurer exploring a cursed tomb, a guy running from a eldricht monster, or a space pirate who's on the hunt for more cyber-rum...
It's all up to you.

If you want to help, fork this repository and add a new feature or fix a bug, then make a pull-request. If your pull-request is good, it will be merged into the master branch.
